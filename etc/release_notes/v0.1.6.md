# Release 0.1.6 (21/02/2023)

Dear all,

we are happy to announce coq-lsp version 0.1.6.

There are quite a few highlights for this release, including many
important fixes, official Windows support (thanks to Jim Portegies for
feedback and bold testing), a new goal printer (ported from Shachar's
Itzhaky jsCoq code by Ramkumar Ramachandra), ability to save .vo files
for open buffers (without rechecking them), support for projects with
multiple `_CoqProject` files, and a status bar icon allowing to
control the status of the server.

Documentation and testing infrastructure has also been improved, and
in particular a start of a SerAPI migration guide has been added.

A new `coq/getDocument` extension will greatly help clients that want
to process Coq documents in a more structured way (thanks to
Clément-Pit Claudel for feedback).

There are still many small tweaks to perform in terms of UI
refinement, most of them are easy long-hanging fruit so contributions
and bug reports are very welcome!
